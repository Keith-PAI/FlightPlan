# General Aviation Flight Planning App Research

## Overview
This document compiles research from Reddit, pilot forums, and aviation tool reviews to inform the development of a browser-based general aviation flight planning tool.

## High-Priority Features
- Interactive route planning with VFR/IFR charts and drag-and-drop routing.
- Aviation weather briefings: METARs, TAFs, radar, winds aloft, AIRMET/SIGMETs, PIREPs.
- NOTAMs and TFRs graphically displayed.
- Weight and balance calculator with saved aircraft profiles.
- Aircraft performance estimates factoring in winds aloft.
- Airport information: runways, frequencies, approach plates.
- Map features: terrain, airspace overlays, vertical profile.

## Medium-Priority Features
- Fuel price overlays with AirNav or ForeFlight Directory.
- Altitude optimization based on forecast winds.
- Flight plan export to ForeFlight (.fpl), Garmin (.gfp), or GPX.
- Integration with 1800wxbrief for flight plan filing.
- Aircraft checklist storage.
- Terrain alerts and alternate airport planning.
- Split-screen planning views.

## Wow Factor Features
- 3D terrain map visualization.
- Graphical NOTAM overlays (e.g., highlighting closed runways).
- Radial menu UI for common tasks.
- Live ADS-B integration for traffic and weather (mobile phase).
- AI-based optimization (departure time, weather routing).
- Social flight planning and sharing.
- Engine log integration (Garmin avionics).

## UX/UI Best Practices
- Clean, uncluttered interface with progressive disclosure.
- Touch-friendly controls for tablet use.
- Dark mode/night vision theme toggle.
- Visual iconography (weather, fuel, airports).
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile.
- Radial or contextual menus for in-cockpit ease of use.

## Integrations
- Export to ForeFlight and Garmin Pilot.
- FAA, NOAA, and 1800wxbrief APIs.
- Mapping overlays with Mapbox or FAA tiles.
- Future: CloudAhoy export, Garmin engine log sync.
