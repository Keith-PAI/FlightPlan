## üéØ Project Vision

FlightPlan differentiates itself by offering a clean, uncluttered interface with features that pilots consistently request but find lacking in existing tools - particularly **graphical NOTAM visualization**, simplified UX design, and strong integration capabilities with existing EFB apps like ForeFlight and Garmin Pilot.

### Key Differentiators
- **Graphical NOTAM Display** - Visual representation of NOTAMs on airport diagrams (most requested missing feature)
- **Progressive Disclosure UI** - Essential information visible, advanced features organized to reduce cognitive load
- **Single-Pilot Operation** - Optimized for minimal head-down time in cockpit environments
- **EFB Integration** - Native ForeFlight (.fpl) and Garmin (.gfp) export formats
- **Touch-Optimized** - Designed for iPad Mini and tablet use with 48px+ touch targets

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Built with modern web technologies and aviation-specific design patterns:

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **State Management**: Zustand with persistence
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with aviation design system
- **Mapping**: Mapbox GL JS with Leaflet fallback
- **APIs**: NOAA Weather, FAA NOTAMs, Chart overlays
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages with PWA support
