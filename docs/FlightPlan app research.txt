Desired Features for General Aviation Flight Planning App

Overview
General aviation (GA) pilots and single-pilot operators rely on flight planning tools that provide all key information in one place. The “gold standard” is ForeFlight – a comprehensive app that “does everything any non-airline pilot would want”
reddit.com
. Any modern, browser-based planning app should match these core capabilities and offer a clean, intuitive interface. Below we outline the essential features pilots consistently expect, additional highly-desired features, and standout “cool” features that could differentiate a new tool. We also discuss UX/UI ideas to improve usability and integration opportunities with popular apps like ForeFlight and Garmin Pilot. Finally, a summary table ranks features by priority.
High-Priority Core Features (Essential for GA Flight Planning)
These features are frequently mentioned as must-haves for any flight planning app targeted at GA pilots. They constitute the baseline functionality expected, often mirroring what ForeFlight, Garmin Pilot, SkyVector, and similar tools already provide:
Interactive Route Planning on VFR/IFR Charts: The ability to plan routes on sectional charts (for VFR) and IFR low/high enroute charts is fundamental
reddit.com
reddit.com
. Pilots want to plot courses by clicking or entering waypoints, with drag-and-drop route editing. Essential map layers include world VFR maps, TACs, and IFR charts
reddit.com
. Integration of airspace boundaries and navigation aids is assumed. A printed or digital navigation log output with course, distance, heading, ETE, fuel, etc., is valuable for VFR cross-country planning
reddit.com
.
Aviation Weather Briefing: GA pilots emphasize up-to-date weather info along the route. Core weather features include current METARs and TAFs for departure, destination, and alternates
reddit.com
, as well as NEXRAD radar and satellite imagery overlays. Winds aloft forecasts (for fuel/groundspeed planning) and graphical prog charts or GFA (Graphical Forecast for Aviation) are highly valued. PIREPs and AIRMET/SIGMETs should be shown visually on the map at their reported locations
reddit.com
. For example, one developer’s app included PIREPs pinned at altitude with decoding, and Air/Sigmets drawn as 3D polygons on the map
reddit.com
. All this weather data is freely available from FAA sources, so the key is displaying it clearly
reddit.com
. Pilots expect an official weather brief package (like the FAA standard briefing) to ensure all bases are covered.
NOTAMs and TFRs: Essential for regulatory compliance and safety, NOTAMs (Notices to Air Missions) must be included in any briefing. However, pilots often complain raw NOTAM text is cumbersome. A highly desired feature is a better NOTAM display – for instance, graphically highlighting relevant NOTAMs on charts (e.g. closed runways marked on airport diagrams)
reddit.com
. One pilot specifically suggested integrating NOTAMs into taxi diagrams or maps with clickable highlights that reveal details
reddit.com
. TFRs (Temporary Flight Restrictions) are a critical subset of NOTAMs frequently mentioned; these should be shown on the map (often as red circles/polygons) so pilots can avoid restricted areas
reddit.com
. FltPlan Go (a free app) is noted for including “TFRs, all the stuff that ForeFlight has”
reddit.com
, underscoring that TFR mapping is expected.
Weight & Balance (W&B): GA pilots often need to compute weight and balance for each flight, especially in small single-engine aircraft. A built-in W&B calculator that can save multiple aircraft profiles is considered essential. Threads on r/flying confirm demand for apps to “save every single plane” and quickly check weight and CG (center of gravity) before flight
reddit.com
. Key capabilities include entering passenger, baggage, and fuel weights and seeing CG plotted against the allowable envelope (with clear red/green indicators for limits)
reddit.com
. While some pilots currently use standalone W&B apps or spreadsheets, having it integrated into the planning tool is a big convenience.
Aircraft Performance Planning: Beyond basic route distance, pilots expect the app to calculate fuel burn, flight time, and performance based on the specific aircraft. This includes factoring winds aloft and possibly altitude. At a minimum, pilots want to input an aircraft profile (cruise speed, fuel burn) and have the software compute leg times and fuel required. More advanced tools allow multiple climb/cruise profiles or even automated performance calculations. In fact, one commonly wished-for feature is smarter performance profiles that account for different altitudes and power settings without needing separate profiles for each
reddit.com
. A user noted that ForeFlight’s basic plan assumes constant TAS/fuel burn and requires “a dozen profiles per plane” for accurate fuel/time planning at various altitudes
reddit.com
. A modern app that automatically adjusts performance for altitude, temperature, etc., at the core (basic subscription) level would be highly valued.
Airport Information & Charts: Pilots need quick access to airport data: runway lengths and surfaces, frequencies, elevation, traffic pattern altitudes, fuel availability, etc. Much of this is in the FAA Chart Supplement (formerly A/FD). A good tool lets users click an airport and see its info page (or even download the official supplement page)
reddit.com
. Integrating official airport diagrams and approach plates is also expected for IFR-capable apps. Even VFR pilots appreciate having taxi diagrams for unfamiliar airports. Free tools like FltPlan.com and SkyVector provide at least the basics; ForeFlight and others include geo-referenced approach plates for situational awareness. While approach procedures might be more advanced, including at least an option to view terminal procedures (IAPs, SIDs, STARs) is increasingly standard. In fact, FltPlan Go is noted to have “geo referenced approach plates, weather, TFRs – all the stuff ForeFlight has”
reddit.com
. For VFR pilots, having pattern entry diagrams or frequencies (CTAF, tower, ground) readily visible is useful. Overall, comprehensive airport info in-app saves pilots from flipping through external documents.
Mapping and Airspace Awareness: A fundamental feature is an interactive moving-map style interface showing planned route, waypoints, and airspace. Users should be able to toggle layers such as terrain, obstacles, and special use airspace. For example, highlighting MOAs or restricted areas along the route is important (with times of use if possible). Many pilots also appreciate terrain elevation coloring or alerts – e.g. showing terrain that impinges on the planned altitude (ForeFlight’s Hazard Advisor does this in higher tiers). At minimum, the app should warn if a chosen cruise altitude is below safe terrain clearance. Tools like SkyVector allow overlaying terrain and even a vertical profile view; modern apps often include a profile view that shows terrain, obstacles, and airspace along the route horizontally. This feature isn’t always in “core” lists, but it’s becoming more common and highly valued for situational awareness.
Medium-Priority Features (Valuable “Nice-to-Haves”)
These features are frequently requested or useful but might be considered second-tier in priority. They add significant value and convenience, though some are available through separate services or higher subscription levels in existing apps:
Fuel Price Integration & Fuel Planning: For many GA pilots, especially those flying cross-country on a budget, fuel price data is extremely useful. ForeFlight and Garmin Pilot include fuel price map layers (often color-coded by price) to help plan economical fuel stops
blog.foreflight.com
. Users discuss checking AirNav or AOPA for fuel prices if their app doesn’t have it
pilotworkshop.com
. Integrating a fuel price database (e.g. AirNav’s) into the map would let pilots identify the cheapest fuel along or near their route – a much-appreciated feature for a “modern” planner. A fuel stop planner could even suggest where to stop for fuel based on price and remaining range. While not every local flight needs this, pilots mention this as a great tool for longer trips
pilotworkshop.com
.
Altitude and Route Optimization: Automation to assist in choosing the best altitude or route is a valued feature, especially for longer flights. For instance, a tool could analyze winds aloft and suggest the optimal cruise altitude for the fastest or most fuel-efficient trip. Similarly, for IFR pilots, suggesting optimized routes or showing recently cleared IFR routes between two airports is helpful. ForeFlight’s “Expected Route” and autoroute suggestions from ATC data are examples. While many GA pilots simply choose a cruising altitude based on aircraft capability and winds manually, having the app highlight “fastest alt” or “fuel saver alt” is a nice upgrade. Some pilots on forums have mentioned wanting the app to “audit your flight plan and suggest optimizations” (as a Facebook discussion noted)
facebook.com
. This could be a medium priority feature to implement once core functions are in place.
Electronic Flight Plan Filing: Integration with filing services (e.g. Leidos 1800wxbrief) is often requested by pilots who want a one-stop solution. The FAA’s free 1800wxbrief.com site itself offers filing and briefing, and some pilots use it in tandem with planning tools
reddit.com
. A modern planner could allow pilots to file their flight plan (VFR or IFR) directly from the app, sending the plan to ATC/FSS. This requires an interface to the FAA’s system (or use of an API via Leidos), but it’s a huge convenience. It ensures the plan matches the planned route exactly and that weather briefing and filing are connected. Many existing apps (ForeFlight, Garmin, FltPlan.com) support filing, so while it might not be initially required for a public/no-login app, it’s definitely a highly desirable addition as the tool matures.
Flight Plan Export/Sharing (ForeFlight/Garmin integration): Even without a built-in filing system, users appreciate being able to export or share their plans. A useful feature is exporting the route to common formats (GPX, FPL, etc.) so that pilots can load it into their panel GPS or another app. In particular, integration with ForeFlight and Garmin Pilot is often mentioned. For example, Garmin’s FltPlan.com web planner lets you plan on desktop and then “push it to your iPad” in Garmin Pilot
reddit.com
. Pilots gave +1 to using fltplan.com because if you choose Garmin Pilot on your tablet, you can seamlessly send the desktop plan to the mobile app
reddit.com
. A similar workflow for ForeFlight (perhaps exporting a .fpl file that ForeFlight can import) would be valuable. Even simply generating a URL or file that a user can open in those apps adds convenience. This kind of integration blurs into “wow factor” if made very smooth (like one-click transfer), but basic export capability is a medium priority for interoperability.
Electronic Logbook Integration: ForeFlight includes an e-logbook, and some pilots use it to automatically log flights (especially if connected to GPS track data). While not every pilot needs a digital logbook, having basic logbook functionality or at least exporting flight details to CSV can be a nice add-on. It’s mentioned less frequently than planning features, but some value having an integrated log (e.g. to track hours, currency, etc.). Given this app will start public with no login, logbook might not fit initially, but could be revisited once accounts exist.
Checklists and Documents: Many pilots carry aircraft checklists and reference documents (POH excerpts, etc.) in their EFB. ForeFlight, for example, allows storing PDF documents and has interactive checklists. While community discussions prioritize planning and weather features, simplifying pilot workflow by including these auxiliary tools is appreciated. A checklist feature (perhaps customizable per aircraft) could be medium priority – especially for a future phase when in-cockpit use grows. Likewise, linking to the aircraft’s POH or an emergency procedures quick-reference from within the app adds value. One r/flying discussion praised ForeFlight for “integrating everything like documentation so well”
reddit.com
reddit.com
, highlighting that having all info in one place (charts, weather, weight & balance, checklists, documents, etc.) is part of what makes ForeFlight so powerful.
Terrain and Airspace Alerts: Expanding on core mapping, additional safety tools could rank as medium priority. For example, a vertical route profile view (if not included initially) that shows terrain and airspace clearance can be added later. Real-time terrain avoidance alerts (e.g., warning if a leg’s altitude is below terrain or obstacle by a certain margin) are more advanced but very useful for single-pilot safety. Similarly, alerts for entering airspace (like “Approaching Class C airspace”) are features in some EFBs that, while not strictly necessary for planning (more for in-flight), could be considered if the app ever provides real-time navigation mode.
Alternate Airport & Diversion Planning: IFR pilots must designate alternates, and even VFR pilots like to have backup options. A nice-to-have feature is assistance with alternate selection – e.g. showing weather and fuel info for candidate alternates near the destination or along the route. Even a simple display of nearby airports (with distance/fuel required to reach them) can help with diversion planning. This tends to be mentioned by more experienced pilots or IFR planners, so it’s a medium priority but adds professionalism to the app’s capabilities.
In summary, these medium-priority items often surface as feature requests once pilots are happy with the basics. They can be phased in to keep users engaged and differentiate the app further from bare-bones free tools.
“Wow Factor” Features (Standout Differentiators)
To truly set a new flight planning app apart, certain innovative or flashy features can create a “wow” factor. These are less commonly found (or are premium in legacy apps) and can generate buzz among pilots:
3D Maps and Terrain Visualization: One standout idea is a 3D interactive map showing terrain and route. The concept is “SkyVector but more modern, with 3D maps, terrain etc.” as one developer described
reddit.com
. This could mean a Google Earth-style view where pilots can see their flight path over a 3D terrain model, or tilt the map to visualize terrain elevations relative to the route. In the Reddit community, this was actually implemented by a PPL/software developer, who allowed VFR sectional charts to be overlaid on 3D terrain
reddit.com
. Such a feature can impress pilots (especially VFR flyers in mountainous regions who value terrain awareness). It’s a clear differentiator since ForeFlight’s 3D view is available but in higher tiers, and most web-based tools don’t have it. A well-implemented 3D mode for planning (not just in-flight synthetic vision) would be a “cool” modern feature.
Augmented Reality Previews: Pushing the envelope further, an AR feature (using a mobile device camera to overlay navigation info or waypoints on the real horizon) would certainly be novel. This might be more hypothetical – not directly requested on forums – but conceptually, allowing pilots to preview a flight by visualizing waypoints or airport locations in AR could be a wow-factor. This is speculative and would require significant tech, so it’s an example of far-future differentiation.
Graphical NOTAM Depiction: As mentioned, NOTAMs are usually text-heavy. A tool that visualizes NOTAMs in context (e.g., drawing a 5 NM radius around an airport for a parachute jumping NOTAM, or highlighting a closed runway on the diagram) would delight many pilots. One pilot quipped that making NOTAMs clear and concise – perhaps “incorporate them into taxi charts as a highlight or overlay” – would be “amazing”
reddit.com
. This goes beyond what most apps do and would stand out as a user-centric innovation (potentially “doing the FAA’s job” of better NOTAM presentation
reddit.com
). Even highlighting obstacle NOTAMs on the route line or showing UAV activity areas graphically could fall here.
Advanced Engine and Aircraft Data Integration: For pilots flying with modern Garmin avionics, having the app integrate with engine monitoring data is a wow factor. Garmin Pilot, for instance, can automatically import engine logs (EIS data) from Garmin-equipped planes into its logbook
reddit.com
. This enables trend analysis of engine performance. While this only benefits those with compatible aircraft systems, it’s a unique selling point. An app that could connect to an aircraft’s data (perhaps via an SD card upload or a cloud sync) and display engine performance trends, fuel usage, etc. after flights would differentiate itself. It turns the planner into part of the post-flight debriefing toolkit as well. This was highlighted as an “important Garmin feature” by a pilot: always having engine data logged for each flight with no extra effort
reddit.com
.
Integration with ADS-B and Live Tracking: Another potential wow feature is the ability to interface with ADS-B IN receivers (like Stratux, Sentry, etc.) to show live weather and traffic on the app. Currently, web apps in an iFrame might not do this, but if eventually packaged as a mobile app or PWA, connecting to a GDL-90 protocol feed to display live traffic, weather, and FIS-B info would be huge. The Reddit developer of a planning app specifically mentioned interest in covering “GDL90 and the FIS-B products provided by the FAA” as a goal
reddit.com
. If our app ever supports in-cockpit use, being able to show live ADS-B weather/traffic on a tablet would put it on par with full EFBs – a major wow-factor for a browser-based tool.
AI-Based Flight Assistance: Emerging tech like AI could be leveraged for features such as intelligent flight plan suggestions or personalized alerts. Imagine an AI that reviews your plan and suggests “You might consider leaving 2 hours earlier to avoid thunderstorms” or auto-generates a plan based on minimal input. While not explicitly requested on forums, pilots have hinted at wanting tools to “make flight planning easier” through automation
facebook.com
. An AI co-pilot for planning (fuel stop optimizer, risk assessment, etc.) could be a futuristic differentiator.
Social and Collaborative Features: This is more niche, but a platform that lets pilots share flight plans with friends or instructors, or collaboratively plan (e.g., a CFI reviewing a student’s cross-country plan remotely) could stand out. Some existing tools let users share plan links (SkyVector can generate a link to a plan). Taking it further with real-time collaboration or community sharing of favorite routes (“$100 hamburger” runs, scenic flights, etc.) would appeal to certain pilot communities.
Crucially, while these wow-factor features generate excitement, they should be built on top of a solid foundation of core functionality. As one Redditor bluntly put it, GA pilots “aren’t looking for flash and gadgets” without utility
reddit.com
reddit.com
. The trick is ensuring these differentiators genuinely improve the pilot’s experience (fun or safety) and aren’t just gimmicks. When done right, though, standout features can give a new app its identity in a crowded market.
User Experience (UX) and UI Design Ideas
A common theme in discussions is interface usability, especially for single-pilot operation. Pilots often use these tools in high-workload environments, so a clean and efficient UI is prized. Several ideas emerge from community feedback:
Simplicity & Clarity: Many pilots feel existing apps, while powerful, are cluttered. The example given by the Reddit poster was ForeFlight’s “25 tiny buttons on screen” and wondering if more than a few are actually useful mid-flight
reddit.com
reddit.com
. Seasoned pilots responded that yes, those buttons are there for good reasons
reddit.com
 – but also agreed they’re not all used at once, only as needed. This indicates a design opportunity: use contextual menus and progressive disclosure so the screen isn’t overloaded. Show primary functions prominently (e.g., map, weather, plan summary) and keep rarely used tools accessible but hidden until invoked. The interface should feel unintimidating to new users yet allow power users to drill down into advanced features.
Radial Menu for In-Flight Tools: Garmin Pilot’s UI includes a radial menu (a circular pop-up menu) to access common tasks quickly. A pilot specifically lauded Garmin’s radial menu as making in-flight access “so much faster and easier”
reddit.com
. Adopting a similar approach in a browser app – perhaps a radial or pie menu when you long-press on the map or a waypoint – could improve usability. For example, tapping an airport could bring up a radial menu with options like “Weather”, “NOTAMs”, “Frequencies”, “Add as Waypoint” in a big easy-to-tap format. This is both a UX improvement and a bit of a modern, cool widget.
Split-Screen Views: Especially on larger screens or tablets, pilots value split-screen capability. Garmin and ForeFlight both allow, say, map on one side and approach plate or profile view on the other
reddit.com
. Designing the app to support an embedded split view (or multiple panels) would enhance usability. For a web app in iFrame, this might mean the app itself can show two panes (rather than relying on device split-screen). For instance, one could pin the weight & balance form next to the route map while planning, or show a vertical profile under the horizontal map. This addresses different information needs without constant toggling.
Dark Mode and Night Adaptation: Aviation apps are commonly used in dark cockpits at night, so a night mode (dim, red-light compatible theme) is important. The branding palette from PAI Consulting can include a dark variant for night use. Users expect to be able to switch to a dark theme to preserve night vision. This is a basic UI consideration but critical for user comfort.
Customizability: Pilots fly different types of missions, so allowing some user configuration of the interface is beneficial. For example, one pilot might always want to see a particular data block (ETA, fuel remaining) on the map, while another cares about altitude or distance rings. Incorporating settings to show/hide various overlays or to rearrange info blocks gives users a sense of control. Since initially there’s no login, customization might be limited (or stored in local browser storage), but down the line, user profiles could save UI preferences.
Responsive Design: The app will be embedded on a Squarespace site and also published on GitHub Pages, meaning people may access it from desktops, tablets, or phones. A responsive layout that works with mouse or touch input is key. Some pilot forums note that certain apps (Garmin Pilot’s Android version, for example) suffer on certain devices
reddit.com
reddit.com
. Ensuring the browser app feels native on an iPad (touch-friendly buttons, pinch-zoom maps) yet also efficient on a PC with keyboard/mouse (maybe keyboard shortcuts for zoom, etc.) will widen its appeal. Testing on common pilot devices (iPad Mini, etc.) is implied.
Fast and Reliable Performance: Pilots value stability – an app that freezes or lags is a non-starter, especially if used in the cockpit. The UI should be optimized for smooth panning/zooming of maps and quick loading of data (perhaps by caching charts). Anecdotes from airline pilots show that platform choice (iPad vs Surface) made a huge difference in app responsiveness
reddit.com
reddit.com
. While our app is web-based, ensuring it’s lightweight and efficient will improve UX.
Visual Design & Branding: The provided PAI Consulting branding (color palette, logos) should be applied for a professional look. Consistent aviation-themed icons (perhaps standard symbols for waypoints, aircraft, wind, etc.) will make the interface feel familiar. Using intuitive symbols and labeling (e.g., a wind barb icon for winds aloft layer, a fuel pump for fuel prices layer) helps users quickly find features. Since the user specifically mentioned branding, maintaining a polished visual style aligned with that brand will build credibility.
In summary, UX/UI efforts should focus on making complex information digestible at a glance. GA pilots often operate solo, so the interface should act like a good co-pilot: presenting crucial info clearly, minimizing fiddling, and reducing head-down time. Community feedback suggests that an app which might not have every feature of ForeFlight could still attract users if it’s easier or more pleasant to use.
Integration with ForeFlight, Garmin Pilot, and More
Interoperability with existing ecosystems is a big plus. Many pilots already use ForeFlight or Garmin Pilot; a new web app can complement these rather than compete outright initially. Key integration opportunities include:
Flight Plan Export/Import: As discussed, support exporting flight plans in ForeFlight .fpl format, Garmin .gfp, GPX, or even the older .flp (FltPlan) formats. This allows a pilot to plan on the web (which some find more convenient on a big screen) and then load the plan into their EFB app in the cockpit. Garmin’s ecosystem already encourages desktop planning via fltplan.com with a direct sync to Garmin Pilot
reddit.com
. For ForeFlight users, our app could generate a file or link that can be emailed or Airdropped to an iPad and opened in ForeFlight. This kind of integration addresses the “no account” public nature – users could leverage our planning tool freely, then take the result into their app of choice for navigation.
ForeFlight Web Integration: ForeFlight has a relatively new web planner (plan.foreflight.com) that syncs with the mobile app for subscribers. Direct integration is likely closed, but perhaps providing an “Open in ForeFlight Web” capability (for those with ForeFlight accounts) could be explored. Alternatively, simply ensuring our app can output a route string that ForeFlight can parse (ForeFlight accepts copy-pasted route strings and interprets them) would be a lightweight integration.
Garmin Panel Integration: If targeting advanced users, consider compatibility with Garmin panel avionics data formats. For instance, exporting a flight plan that can be loaded onto an SD card for a Garmin GTN or G1000 navigator. While beyond the scope of casual users, this would appeal to owners of equipped aircraft who might want to plan on a PC and fly with their panel’s GPS.
Data Sources and Accounts: Integration with 1800wxbrief (Leidos) can serve dual purpose: retrieving official weather briefings and filing plans. Possibly, the app could allow a user to log in to their Leidos account (if they want) to file or store briefings. This is something to consider if adding accounts. For weather, other integrations like NOAA’s AviationWeather.gov (which provides APIs for METAR/TAF, etc.) are more behind-the-scenes but ensure data quality.
Third-Party Services: There are other specialized services popular with pilots that could integrate:
CloudAhoy (for post-flight analysis and debrief) – maybe allow exporting a planned route to CloudAhoy for use in debrief or connecting actual flown track back to the plan.
Aircraft performance databases like POH Performance or manufacturer data – possibly pulling aircraft climb/cruise data if the user selects an aircraft model (this could auto-fill performance profiles, a nice integration).
Fuel price databases (AirNav, ForeFlight Directory API if accessible) – for updating fuel costs.
Mapping APIs: using something like Mapbox or Google for satellite imagery or roads (the Reddit dev blended Bing road maps under sectional charts
reddit.com
, which pilots enjoyed for identifying ground features). Ensuring usage complies with licensing, but technically layering sectional charts over Google/Bing maps yields a richer planning map.
Community & Social Integration: If the tool gains a user base, integration with social platforms or pilot networks could spread adoption. For example, a simple “Share to Reddit” or Facebook button for a flight plan (posting an image or link of the route) might attract interest from communities like r/flying. Not a core integration, but worth noting given how influential pilot communities are in recommending tools.
ForeFlight/Garmin Feature Parity: While full parity is ambitious, targeting a few key integrations ForeFlight/Garmin users love will help. For instance, Garmin Pilot’s Database Concierge (one-touch transfer of data to panel) is a beloved feature
reddit.com
 – while our app likely won’t update panel firmware, understanding why pilots like it (less manual data handling) can inform integrations. ForeFlight’s rich document catalog (NavLogs, weather briefs, etc.) is another area – maybe our app can export a PDF briefing document that a pilot could import into ForeFlight’s Documents tab for reference. Little touches like that make the tools play nicely together.
It’s clear from discussions that pilots mix and match tools (e.g., “I use SkyVector for planning and then Avare in flight”
reddit.com
). Embracing that reality by making our planner compatible and complementary will win pilot approval. One Redditor advised a would-be developer that beating ForeFlight on features is tough without “hundreds of engineers,” so maybe find a niche or angle
reddit.com
reddit.com
. Integration could be that angle – be the web planner that plays well with everything. If the app later introduces accounts, partnering or integrating with major platforms (even if just via import/export) will smooth that transition for users.

Overview
General aviation (GA) pilots and single-pilot operators rely on flight planning tools that provide all key information in one place. The “gold standard” is ForeFlight – a comprehensive app that “does everything any non-airline pilot would want”
reddit.com
. Any modern, browser-based planning app should match these core capabilities and offer a clean, intuitive interface. Below we outline the essential features pilots consistently expect, additional highly-desired features, and standout “cool” features that could differentiate a new tool. We also discuss UX/UI ideas to improve usability and integration opportunities with popular apps like ForeFlight and Garmin Pilot. Finally, a summary table ranks features by priority.
High-Priority Core Features (Essential for GA Flight Planning)
These features are frequently mentioned as must-haves for any flight planning app targeted at GA pilots. They constitute the baseline functionality expected, often mirroring what ForeFlight, Garmin Pilot, SkyVector, and similar tools already provide:
Interactive Route Planning on VFR/IFR Charts: The ability to plan routes on sectional charts (for VFR) and IFR low/high enroute charts is fundamental
reddit.com
reddit.com
. Pilots want to plot courses by clicking or entering waypoints, with drag-and-drop route editing. Essential map layers include world VFR maps, TACs, and IFR charts
reddit.com
. Integration of airspace boundaries and navigation aids is assumed. A printed or digital navigation log output with course, distance, heading, ETE, fuel, etc., is valuable for VFR cross-country planning
reddit.com
.
Aviation Weather Briefing: GA pilots emphasize up-to-date weather info along the route. Core weather features include current METARs and TAFs for departure, destination, and alternates
reddit.com
, as well as NEXRAD radar and satellite imagery overlays. Winds aloft forecasts (for fuel/groundspeed planning) and graphical prog charts or GFA (Graphical Forecast for Aviation) are highly valued. PIREPs and AIRMET/SIGMETs should be shown visually on the map at their reported locations
reddit.com
. For example, one developer’s app included PIREPs pinned at altitude with decoding, and Air/Sigmets drawn as 3D polygons on the map
reddit.com
. All this weather data is freely available from FAA sources, so the key is displaying it clearly
reddit.com
. Pilots expect an official weather brief package (like the FAA standard briefing) to ensure all bases are covered.
NOTAMs and TFRs: Essential for regulatory compliance and safety, NOTAMs (Notices to Air Missions) must be included in any briefing. However, pilots often complain raw NOTAM text is cumbersome. A highly desired feature is a better NOTAM display – for instance, graphically highlighting relevant NOTAMs on charts (e.g. closed runways marked on airport diagrams)
reddit.com
. One pilot specifically suggested integrating NOTAMs into taxi diagrams or maps with clickable highlights that reveal details
reddit.com
. TFRs (Temporary Flight Restrictions) are a critical subset of NOTAMs frequently mentioned; these should be shown on the map (often as red circles/polygons) so pilots can avoid restricted areas
reddit.com
. FltPlan Go (a free app) is noted for including “TFRs, all the stuff that ForeFlight has”
reddit.com
, underscoring that TFR mapping is expected.
Weight & Balance (W&B): GA pilots often need to compute weight and balance for each flight, especially in small single-engine aircraft. A built-in W&B calculator that can save multiple aircraft profiles is considered essential. Threads on r/flying confirm demand for apps to “save every single plane” and quickly check weight and CG (center of gravity) before flight
reddit.com
. Key capabilities include entering passenger, baggage, and fuel weights and seeing CG plotted against the allowable envelope (with clear red/green indicators for limits)
reddit.com
. While some pilots currently use standalone W&B apps or spreadsheets, having it integrated into the planning tool is a big convenience.
Aircraft Performance Planning: Beyond basic route distance, pilots expect the app to calculate fuel burn, flight time, and performance based on the specific aircraft. This includes factoring winds aloft and possibly altitude. At a minimum, pilots want to input an aircraft profile (cruise speed, fuel burn) and have the software compute leg times and fuel required. More advanced tools allow multiple climb/cruise profiles or even automated performance calculations. In fact, one commonly wished-for feature is smarter performance profiles that account for different altitudes and power settings without needing separate profiles for each
reddit.com
. A user noted that ForeFlight’s basic plan assumes constant TAS/fuel burn and requires “a dozen profiles per plane” for accurate fuel/time planning at various altitudes
reddit.com
. A modern app that automatically adjusts performance for altitude, temperature, etc., at the core (basic subscription) level would be highly valued.
Airport Information & Charts: Pilots need quick access to airport data: runway lengths and surfaces, frequencies, elevation, traffic pattern altitudes, fuel availability, etc. Much of this is in the FAA Chart Supplement (formerly A/FD). A good tool lets users click an airport and see its info page (or even download the official supplement page)
reddit.com
. Integrating official airport diagrams and approach plates is also expected for IFR-capable apps. Even VFR pilots appreciate having taxi diagrams for unfamiliar airports. Free tools like FltPlan.com and SkyVector provide at least the basics; ForeFlight and others include geo-referenced approach plates for situational awareness. While approach procedures might be more advanced, including at least an option to view terminal procedures (IAPs, SIDs, STARs) is increasingly standard. In fact, FltPlan Go is noted to have “geo referenced approach plates, weather, TFRs – all the stuff ForeFlight has”
reddit.com
. For VFR pilots, having pattern entry diagrams or frequencies (CTAF, tower, ground) readily visible is useful. Overall, comprehensive airport info in-app saves pilots from flipping through external documents.
Mapping and Airspace Awareness: A fundamental feature is an interactive moving-map style interface showing planned route, waypoints, and airspace. Users should be able to toggle layers such as terrain, obstacles, and special use airspace. For example, highlighting MOAs or restricted areas along the route is important (with times of use if possible). Many pilots also appreciate terrain elevation coloring or alerts – e.g. showing terrain that impinges on the planned altitude (ForeFlight’s Hazard Advisor does this in higher tiers). At minimum, the app should warn if a chosen cruise altitude is below safe terrain clearance. Tools like SkyVector allow overlaying terrain and even a vertical profile view; modern apps often include a profile view that shows terrain, obstacles, and airspace along the route horizontally. This feature isn’t always in “core” lists, but it’s becoming more common and highly valued for situational awareness.
Medium-Priority Features (Valuable “Nice-to-Haves”)
These features are frequently requested or useful but might be considered second-tier in priority. They add significant value and convenience, though some are available through separate services or higher subscription levels in existing apps:
Fuel Price Integration & Fuel Planning: For many GA pilots, especially those flying cross-country on a budget, fuel price data is extremely useful. ForeFlight and Garmin Pilot include fuel price map layers (often color-coded by price) to help plan economical fuel stops
blog.foreflight.com
. Users discuss checking AirNav or AOPA for fuel prices if their app doesn’t have it
pilotworkshop.com
. Integrating a fuel price database (e.g. AirNav’s) into the map would let pilots identify the cheapest fuel along or near their route – a much-appreciated feature for a “modern” planner. A fuel stop planner could even suggest where to stop for fuel based on price and remaining range. While not every local flight needs this, pilots mention this as a great tool for longer trips
pilotworkshop.com
.
Altitude and Route Optimization: Automation to assist in choosing the best altitude or route is a valued feature, especially for longer flights. For instance, a tool could analyze winds aloft and suggest the optimal cruise altitude for the fastest or most fuel-efficient trip. Similarly, for IFR pilots, suggesting optimized routes or showing recently cleared IFR routes between two airports is helpful. ForeFlight’s “Expected Route” and autoroute suggestions from ATC data are examples. While many GA pilots simply choose a cruising altitude based on aircraft capability and winds manually, having the app highlight “fastest alt” or “fuel saver alt” is a nice upgrade. Some pilots on forums have mentioned wanting the app to “audit your flight plan and suggest optimizations” (as a Facebook discussion noted)
facebook.com
. This could be a medium priority feature to implement once core functions are in place.
Electronic Flight Plan Filing: Integration with filing services (e.g. Leidos 1800wxbrief) is often requested by pilots who want a one-stop solution. The FAA’s free 1800wxbrief.com site itself offers filing and briefing, and some pilots use it in tandem with planning tools
reddit.com
. A modern planner could allow pilots to file their flight plan (VFR or IFR) directly from the app, sending the plan to ATC/FSS. This requires an interface to the FAA’s system (or use of an API via Leidos), but it’s a huge convenience. It ensures the plan matches the planned route exactly and that weather briefing and filing are connected. Many existing apps (ForeFlight, Garmin, FltPlan.com) support filing, so while it might not be initially required for a public/no-login app, it’s definitely a highly desirable addition as the tool matures.
Flight Plan Export/Sharing (ForeFlight/Garmin integration): Even without a built-in filing system, users appreciate being able to export or share their plans. A useful feature is exporting the route to common formats (GPX, FPL, etc.) so that pilots can load it into their panel GPS or another app. In particular, integration with ForeFlight and Garmin Pilot is often mentioned. For example, Garmin’s FltPlan.com web planner lets you plan on desktop and then “push it to your iPad” in Garmin Pilot
reddit.com
. Pilots gave +1 to using fltplan.com because if you choose Garmin Pilot on your tablet, you can seamlessly send the desktop plan to the mobile app
reddit.com
. A similar workflow for ForeFlight (perhaps exporting a .fpl file that ForeFlight can import) would be valuable. Even simply generating a URL or file that a user can open in those apps adds convenience. This kind of integration blurs into “wow factor” if made very smooth (like one-click transfer), but basic export capability is a medium priority for interoperability.
Electronic Logbook Integration: ForeFlight includes an e-logbook, and some pilots use it to automatically log flights (especially if connected to GPS track data). While not every pilot needs a digital logbook, having basic logbook functionality or at least exporting flight details to CSV can be a nice add-on. It’s mentioned less frequently than planning features, but some value having an integrated log (e.g. to track hours, currency, etc.). Given this app will start public with no login, logbook might not fit initially, but could be revisited once accounts exist.
Checklists and Documents: Many pilots carry aircraft checklists and reference documents (POH excerpts, etc.) in their EFB. ForeFlight, for example, allows storing PDF documents and has interactive checklists. While community discussions prioritize planning and weather features, simplifying pilot workflow by including these auxiliary tools is appreciated. A checklist feature (perhaps customizable per aircraft) could be medium priority – especially for a future phase when in-cockpit use grows. Likewise, linking to the aircraft’s POH or an emergency procedures quick-reference from within the app adds value. One r/flying discussion praised ForeFlight for “integrating everything like documentation so well”
reddit.com
reddit.com
, highlighting that having all info in one place (charts, weather, weight & balance, checklists, documents, etc.) is part of what makes ForeFlight so powerful.
Terrain and Airspace Alerts: Expanding on core mapping, additional safety tools could rank as medium priority. For example, a vertical route profile view (if not included initially) that shows terrain and airspace clearance can be added later. Real-time terrain avoidance alerts (e.g., warning if a leg’s altitude is below terrain or obstacle by a certain margin) are more advanced but very useful for single-pilot safety. Similarly, alerts for entering airspace (like “Approaching Class C airspace”) are features in some EFBs that, while not strictly necessary for planning (more for in-flight), could be considered if the app ever provides real-time navigation mode.
Alternate Airport & Diversion Planning: IFR pilots must designate alternates, and even VFR pilots like to have backup options. A nice-to-have feature is assistance with alternate selection – e.g. showing weather and fuel info for candidate alternates near the destination or along the route. Even a simple display of nearby airports (with distance/fuel required to reach them) can help with diversion planning. This tends to be mentioned by more experienced pilots or IFR planners, so it’s a medium priority but adds professionalism to the app’s capabilities.
In summary, these medium-priority items often surface as feature requests once pilots are happy with the basics. They can be phased in to keep users engaged and differentiate the app further from bare-bones free tools.
“Wow Factor” Features (Standout Differentiators)
To truly set a new flight planning app apart, certain innovative or flashy features can create a “wow” factor. These are less commonly found (or are premium in legacy apps) and can generate buzz among pilots:
3D Maps and Terrain Visualization: One standout idea is a 3D interactive map showing terrain and route. The concept is “SkyVector but more modern, with 3D maps, terrain etc.” as one developer described
reddit.com
. This could mean a Google Earth-style view where pilots can see their flight path over a 3D terrain model, or tilt the map to visualize terrain elevations relative to the route. In the Reddit community, this was actually implemented by a PPL/software developer, who allowed VFR sectional charts to be overlaid on 3D terrain
reddit.com
. Such a feature can impress pilots (especially VFR flyers in mountainous regions who value terrain awareness). It’s a clear differentiator since ForeFlight’s 3D view is available but in higher tiers, and most web-based tools don’t have it. A well-implemented 3D mode for planning (not just in-flight synthetic vision) would be a “cool” modern feature.
Augmented Reality Previews: Pushing the envelope further, an AR feature (using a mobile device camera to overlay navigation info or waypoints on the real horizon) would certainly be novel. This might be more hypothetical – not directly requested on forums – but conceptually, allowing pilots to preview a flight by visualizing waypoints or airport locations in AR could be a wow-factor. This is speculative and would require significant tech, so it’s an example of far-future differentiation.
Graphical NOTAM Depiction: As mentioned, NOTAMs are usually text-heavy. A tool that visualizes NOTAMs in context (e.g., drawing a 5 NM radius around an airport for a parachute jumping NOTAM, or highlighting a closed runway on the diagram) would delight many pilots. One pilot quipped that making NOTAMs clear and concise – perhaps “incorporate them into taxi charts as a highlight or overlay” – would be “amazing”
reddit.com
. This goes beyond what most apps do and would stand out as a user-centric innovation (potentially “doing the FAA’s job” of better NOTAM presentation
reddit.com
). Even highlighting obstacle NOTAMs on the route line or showing UAV activity areas graphically could fall here.
Advanced Engine and Aircraft Data Integration: For pilots flying with modern Garmin avionics, having the app integrate with engine monitoring data is a wow factor. Garmin Pilot, for instance, can automatically import engine logs (EIS data) from Garmin-equipped planes into its logbook
reddit.com
. This enables trend analysis of engine performance. While this only benefits those with compatible aircraft systems, it’s a unique selling point. An app that could connect to an aircraft’s data (perhaps via an SD card upload or a cloud sync) and display engine performance trends, fuel usage, etc. after flights would differentiate itself. It turns the planner into part of the post-flight debriefing toolkit as well. This was highlighted as an “important Garmin feature” by a pilot: always having engine data logged for each flight with no extra effort
reddit.com
.
Integration with ADS-B and Live Tracking: Another potential wow feature is the ability to interface with ADS-B IN receivers (like Stratux, Sentry, etc.) to show live weather and traffic on the app. Currently, web apps in an iFrame might not do this, but if eventually packaged as a mobile app or PWA, connecting to a GDL-90 protocol feed to display live traffic, weather, and FIS-B info would be huge. The Reddit developer of a planning app specifically mentioned interest in covering “GDL90 and the FIS-B products provided by the FAA” as a goal
reddit.com
. If our app ever supports in-cockpit use, being able to show live ADS-B weather/traffic on a tablet would put it on par with full EFBs – a major wow-factor for a browser-based tool.
AI-Based Flight Assistance: Emerging tech like AI could be leveraged for features such as intelligent flight plan suggestions or personalized alerts. Imagine an AI that reviews your plan and suggests “You might consider leaving 2 hours earlier to avoid thunderstorms” or auto-generates a plan based on minimal input. While not explicitly requested on forums, pilots have hinted at wanting tools to “make flight planning easier” through automation
facebook.com
. An AI co-pilot for planning (fuel stop optimizer, risk assessment, etc.) could be a futuristic differentiator.
Social and Collaborative Features: This is more niche, but a platform that lets pilots share flight plans with friends or instructors, or collaboratively plan (e.g., a CFI reviewing a student’s cross-country plan remotely) could stand out. Some existing tools let users share plan links (SkyVector can generate a link to a plan). Taking it further with real-time collaboration or community sharing of favorite routes (“$100 hamburger” runs, scenic flights, etc.) would appeal to certain pilot communities.
Crucially, while these wow-factor features generate excitement, they should be built on top of a solid foundation of core functionality. As one Redditor bluntly put it, GA pilots “aren’t looking for flash and gadgets” without utility
reddit.com
reddit.com
. The trick is ensuring these differentiators genuinely improve the pilot’s experience (fun or safety) and aren’t just gimmicks. When done right, though, standout features can give a new app its identity in a crowded market.
User Experience (UX) and UI Design Ideas
A common theme in discussions is interface usability, especially for single-pilot operation. Pilots often use these tools in high-workload environments, so a clean and efficient UI is prized. Several ideas emerge from community feedback:
Simplicity & Clarity: Many pilots feel existing apps, while powerful, are cluttered. The example given by the Reddit poster was ForeFlight’s “25 tiny buttons on screen” and wondering if more than a few are actually useful mid-flight
reddit.com
reddit.com
. Seasoned pilots responded that yes, those buttons are there for good reasons
reddit.com
 – but also agreed they’re not all used at once, only as needed. This indicates a design opportunity: use contextual menus and progressive disclosure so the screen isn’t overloaded. Show primary functions prominently (e.g., map, weather, plan summary) and keep rarely used tools accessible but hidden until invoked. The interface should feel unintimidating to new users yet allow power users to drill down into advanced features.
Radial Menu for In-Flight Tools: Garmin Pilot’s UI includes a radial menu (a circular pop-up menu) to access common tasks quickly. A pilot specifically lauded Garmin’s radial menu as making in-flight access “so much faster and easier”
reddit.com
. Adopting a similar approach in a browser app – perhaps a radial or pie menu when you long-press on the map or a waypoint – could improve usability. For example, tapping an airport could bring up a radial menu with options like “Weather”, “NOTAMs”, “Frequencies”, “Add as Waypoint” in a big easy-to-tap format. This is both a UX improvement and a bit of a modern, cool widget.
Split-Screen Views: Especially on larger screens or tablets, pilots value split-screen capability. Garmin and ForeFlight both allow, say, map on one side and approach plate or profile view on the other
reddit.com
. Designing the app to support an embedded split view (or multiple panels) would enhance usability. For a web app in iFrame, this might mean the app itself can show two panes (rather than relying on device split-screen). For instance, one could pin the weight & balance form next to the route map while planning, or show a vertical profile under the horizontal map. This addresses different information needs without constant toggling.
Dark Mode and Night Adaptation: Aviation apps are commonly used in dark cockpits at night, so a night mode (dim, red-light compatible theme) is important. The branding palette from PAI Consulting can include a dark variant for night use. Users expect to be able to switch to a dark theme to preserve night vision. This is a basic UI consideration but critical for user comfort.
Customizability: Pilots fly different types of missions, so allowing some user configuration of the interface is beneficial. For example, one pilot might always want to see a particular data block (ETA, fuel remaining) on the map, while another cares about altitude or distance rings. Incorporating settings to show/hide various overlays or to rearrange info blocks gives users a sense of control. Since initially there’s no login, customization might be limited (or stored in local browser storage), but down the line, user profiles could save UI preferences.
Responsive Design: The app will be embedded on a Squarespace site and also published on GitHub Pages, meaning people may access it from desktops, tablets, or phones. A responsive layout that works with mouse or touch input is key. Some pilot forums note that certain apps (Garmin Pilot’s Android version, for example) suffer on certain devices
reddit.com
reddit.com
. Ensuring the browser app feels native on an iPad (touch-friendly buttons, pinch-zoom maps) yet also efficient on a PC with keyboard/mouse (maybe keyboard shortcuts for zoom, etc.) will widen its appeal. Testing on common pilot devices (iPad Mini, etc.) is implied.
Fast and Reliable Performance: Pilots value stability – an app that freezes or lags is a non-starter, especially if used in the cockpit. The UI should be optimized for smooth panning/zooming of maps and quick loading of data (perhaps by caching charts). Anecdotes from airline pilots show that platform choice (iPad vs Surface) made a huge difference in app responsiveness
reddit.com
reddit.com
. While our app is web-based, ensuring it’s lightweight and efficient will improve UX.
Visual Design & Branding: The provided PAI Consulting branding (color palette, logos) should be applied for a professional look. Consistent aviation-themed icons (perhaps standard symbols for waypoints, aircraft, wind, etc.) will make the interface feel familiar. Using intuitive symbols and labeling (e.g., a wind barb icon for winds aloft layer, a fuel pump for fuel prices layer) helps users quickly find features. Since the user specifically mentioned branding, maintaining a polished visual style aligned with that brand will build credibility.
In summary, UX/UI efforts should focus on making complex information digestible at a glance. GA pilots often operate solo, so the interface should act like a good co-pilot: presenting crucial info clearly, minimizing fiddling, and reducing head-down time. Community feedback suggests that an app which might not have every feature of ForeFlight could still attract users if it’s easier or more pleasant to use.
Integration with ForeFlight, Garmin Pilot, and More
Interoperability with existing ecosystems is a big plus. Many pilots already use ForeFlight or Garmin Pilot; a new web app can complement these rather than compete outright initially. Key integration opportunities include:
Flight Plan Export/Import: As discussed, support exporting flight plans in ForeFlight .fpl format, Garmin .gfp, GPX, or even the older .flp (FltPlan) formats. This allows a pilot to plan on the web (which some find more convenient on a big screen) and then load the plan into their EFB app in the cockpit. Garmin’s ecosystem already encourages desktop planning via fltplan.com with a direct sync to Garmin Pilot
reddit.com
. For ForeFlight users, our app could generate a file or link that can be emailed or Airdropped to an iPad and opened in ForeFlight. This kind of integration addresses the “no account” public nature – users could leverage our planning tool freely, then take the result into their app of choice for navigation.
ForeFlight Web Integration: ForeFlight has a relatively new web planner (plan.foreflight.com) that syncs with the mobile app for subscribers. Direct integration is likely closed, but perhaps providing an “Open in ForeFlight Web” capability (for those with ForeFlight accounts) could be explored. Alternatively, simply ensuring our app can output a route string that ForeFlight can parse (ForeFlight accepts copy-pasted route strings and interprets them) would be a lightweight integration.
Garmin Panel Integration: If targeting advanced users, consider compatibility with Garmin panel avionics data formats. For instance, exporting a flight plan that can be loaded onto an SD card for a Garmin GTN or G1000 navigator. While beyond the scope of casual users, this would appeal to owners of equipped aircraft who might want to plan on a PC and fly with their panel’s GPS.
Data Sources and Accounts: Integration with 1800wxbrief (Leidos) can serve dual purpose: retrieving official weather briefings and filing plans. Possibly, the app could allow a user to log in to their Leidos account (if they want) to file or store briefings. This is something to consider if adding accounts. For weather, other integrations like NOAA’s AviationWeather.gov (which provides APIs for METAR/TAF, etc.) are more behind-the-scenes but ensure data quality.
Third-Party Services: There are other specialized services popular with pilots that could integrate:
CloudAhoy (for post-flight analysis and debrief) – maybe allow exporting a planned route to CloudAhoy for use in debrief or connecting actual flown track back to the plan.
Aircraft performance databases like POH Performance or manufacturer data – possibly pulling aircraft climb/cruise data if the user selects an aircraft model (this could auto-fill performance profiles, a nice integration).
Fuel price databases (AirNav, ForeFlight Directory API if accessible) – for updating fuel costs.
Mapping APIs: using something like Mapbox or Google for satellite imagery or roads (the Reddit dev blended Bing road maps under sectional charts
reddit.com
, which pilots enjoyed for identifying ground features). Ensuring usage complies with licensing, but technically layering sectional charts over Google/Bing maps yields a richer planning map.
Community & Social Integration: If the tool gains a user base, integration with social platforms or pilot networks could spread adoption. For example, a simple “Share to Reddit” or Facebook button for a flight plan (posting an image or link of the route) might attract interest from communities like r/flying. Not a core integration, but worth noting given how influential pilot communities are in recommending tools.
ForeFlight/Garmin Feature Parity: While full parity is ambitious, targeting a few key integrations ForeFlight/Garmin users love will help. For instance, Garmin Pilot’s Database Concierge (one-touch transfer of data to panel) is a beloved feature
reddit.com
 – while our app likely won’t update panel firmware, understanding why pilots like it (less manual data handling) can inform integrations. ForeFlight’s rich document catalog (NavLogs, weather briefs, etc.) is another area – maybe our app can export a PDF briefing document that a pilot could import into ForeFlight’s Documents tab for reference. Little touches like that make the tools play nicely together.
It’s clear from discussions that pilots mix and match tools (e.g., “I use SkyVector for planning and then Avare in flight”
reddit.com
). Embracing that reality by making our planner compatible and complementary will win pilot approval. One Redditor advised a would-be developer that beating ForeFlight on features is tough without “hundreds of engineers,” so maybe find a niche or angle
reddit.com
reddit.com
. Integration could be that angle – be the web planner that plays well with everything. If the app later introduces accounts, partnering or integrating with major platforms (even if just via import/export) will smooth that transition for users. Below is a summary table of features categorized by priority, based on frequency of mentions in pilot communities and perceived value:
