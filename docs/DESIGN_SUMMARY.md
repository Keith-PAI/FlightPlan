**Build Configuration:**
- Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- PWA configuration for offline capability
- Automated CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

### 7. Development Infrastructure (`DEVELOPMENT_INFRASTRUCTURE.md`)
**Complete development workflow and deployment strategy**

**CI/CD Pipeline:**
- Automated testing on multiple Node.js versions
- Security scanning and code quality checks
- Staging and production deployment to GitHub Pages
- Performance monitoring with Lighthouse CI

**Quality Assurance:**
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- Husky pre-commit hooks
- Comprehensive test coverage requirements
- Error tracking and performance monitoring

## Key Innovation Areas

**Critical differentiator based on pilot feedback**
- Visual representation of NOTAMs on airport diagrams
- Closed runway highlighting on charts
- TFR polygon overlays with detailed information
- Integration with taxi diagrams for ground operations

### 2. Progressive Disclosure Interface
**Solving the "feature overload" problem**
- Level 1: Essential information always visible
- Level 2: Detailed data accessible with one click
- Level 3: Advanced features in organized menus
- Radial menu system for contextual actions

### 3. Multi-Source Data Integration
**Ensuring reliability for aviation safety**
- Primary and backup weather sources
- Automatic failover with graceful degradation
- Data validation and cross-referencing
- Offline capability with cached data

### 4. EFB Integration Strategy
**Complementary rather than competitive approach**
- Native ForeFlight .fpl export
- Garmin .gfp format support
- Panel GPS compatibility (GTN, G1000)
- Route string parsing for easy import
